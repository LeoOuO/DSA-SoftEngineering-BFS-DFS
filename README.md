# DFS/BFS Graph Visualizer

> 🧠 Group 26 - DSA 2025 Spring  
> 📍 National Taiwan University  

## 📁 Project Structure

- `index.html` – Entry page with intro and instructions.
- `dfs.html` – Main visual interface for DFS and BFS.
- `style.css` – Full styling with responsive dark UI.
- `script.js` – Graph drawing, DFS/BFS logic & animations.
- `DSA_GOD.jpeg` – Background image for graph canvas.

---

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in a browser.
2. Click **"Start ➔"** to enter the visualizer interface.
3. Use sidebar controls to build and explore the graph.

### Controls

| Button       | Function                                           |
|--------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| `Add Node`   | Add a node by clicking the canvas (face of DSA GOD) |
| `Add Edge`   | Connect two nodes                                   |
| `Remove`     | Delete a node or edge                               |
| `DFS`        | Run full Depth-First Search                         |
| `Step DFS`   | Execute DFS step by step                            |
| `BFS`        | Run full Breadth-First Search                       |
| `Step BFS`   | Execute BFS step by step                            |
| `STOP`       | Stop ongoing DFS/BFS animation                      |
| `Reset`      | Clear graph and start over                          |
